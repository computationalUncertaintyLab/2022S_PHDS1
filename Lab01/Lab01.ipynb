    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "All of our lab work will take place in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are a tool for organizing textual descriptions of work and computer programs.\n",
    "The goal is to produce one document to communicate a set of scientific ideas and allow another to understand exactly how you arrived at yoru conclusions.\n",

    "Jupyter has some important buttons. \n",

    "Under file->New->Notebook you can create a new notebook. \n",

    "### The notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is a collection of cells.\n",
    "A **cell** is a container that can hold text or computer code. \n",
    "Cells in Jupyter looks like gray rectangles.\n",
    "There are three cell types in Jupyter: (i) Code, (ii) Markdown, and (iii) Raw.\n",
    "The two that we will focus on are Code and Markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Code\" cell holds computer code that the R kernel (see below about a kernel) can use to compute.\n",
    "We may want to import data, run a statistical analysis, and output results.\n",
    "This is for the \"Code\" cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Markdown\" is itself a special language that a Jupyter Notebook interprets as text. \n",
    "The \"Markdown\" cell is most useful for write ups, descriptions of a Code cell above or below, or scientific conclusions, comments, and thoughts. \n",
    "When you need to write, think Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save your work\n",
    "You can always save your work, and should do so often, by clicking File -> Save Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Export  for submission\n",
    "In class, we will ask that tyou submit your work on Coursesite as a **PDF**. \n",
    "Work in another format will not be accepted. \n",
    "To export your notebook as a PDF, choose File->Save abd Export Notebook As->PDF\n",

    "The kernel is the component that executes code inside your notebook. \n",
    "No kernel, no running code.\n",

    "Over the course, you may find that your notebook has disconnected or otherwise will no longer execute the code you wrote.\n",
    "Most often, the kernel has stopped. \n",

    "\n",
    "The R programming language, while not explictly written for statistics, has a long history as a tool for data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and data science. \n",
    "R supports all of the main paradigms in computing and you will be able to transfer what you learn in R to other programming languages without much difficulty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is difficult.\n",
    "Like any skill, programming take time to master. \n",
    "Error messages will be commonplace, you will find it difficult to ask the computer to calculate what you want. \n",
    "You will be frustrate and that is ok. \n",
    "Over time you will learn to read the error messages, code will flow more easily. \n",
    "The most important part of programming is daily practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we **execute** code, we ask the computer to translate what we wrote into binary and return a set of results that may or may not be stored in memory.\n",
