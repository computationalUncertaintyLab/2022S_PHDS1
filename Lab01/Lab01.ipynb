    "The \"Code\" cell holds computer code that the R kernel (see below about a kernel) can use to compute.\n",
    "We may want to import data, run a statistical analysis, and output results.\n",
    "This is for the \"Code\" cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Markdown\" is itself a special language that a Jupyter Notebook interprets as text. \n",
    "The \"Markdown\" cell is most useful for write ups, descriptions of a Code cell above or below, or scientific conclusions, comments, and thoughts. \n",
