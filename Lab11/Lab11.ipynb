    "\n",
    "The strategy starts by assuming our data follows a random variable with a specific distribution.\n",
    "Then if our random variable has a single parameter we compute the sample mean $\\overline{x}$, set that sample mean equal to the theoretical expected value---which will include this single parameter---and solve for our parameter in terms of our sample mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we collected data $\\mathcal{D} = (0,1,0,1,1)$ and we further assumed this data was generated by $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, X_{4}, X_{5} \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\theta)$. \n",

    "The survey collected from every volunteer: If they report feeling health or not, their age in years, gender, if they have currently active health insurance, if the individual is married, if they are self-employed, the number of members in their family, what region of the US they live, their ethnicity, and highest attained education.
