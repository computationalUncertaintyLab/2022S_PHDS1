    "## Functions\n",

    "Functions in R are used to organize our work, clarify code for others, and allows us to apply the same finite steps to many different objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose we want to use the frequentist approach to assign probabilities to a sample space $\\mathcal{G} = \\{-1,0,1\\}$ based on a dataset $\\mathcal{D}$. Our dataset may look like $\\mathcal{D} = (-1,0,0,1,-1,1,1,1,-1)$.\n",
    "To assign a probability to the event $\\{-1\\}$ we can write R code to count the number of times the outcome $-1$ appears in our data and divide by the number of data points in our data set. For the event $\\{0\\}$ we can write R code to perform the *same steps* for 0 as we performed for the event $\\{-1\\}$. Because we are repeating the same steps for the event $\\{-1\\}$ and for event $\\{0\\}$, a function may simplify our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** We are asked to support a clinical team that collected data on patients who are current smokers and outcomes thought to be linked to smoking. The code needs (i) to be processed, (ii) analyzed, and (iii) reported. Though we can write our code in sequence to perform all three steps, we may be able to better organize our work into three functions: one that processes the data, a function that analyses the data, and a third to report."

    "- *Assignment:* We create a function by assigning a variable name to the function\n",
    "- *Function* :  Next we need to use the reserved word \"function\" so that R knows we are creating a function. \n",
    "- *Arguments*:  After the workd function we will include open and closed parentheses. Inside these parentheses we can include one or more arguments for the function. An argument is an input to our function. \n",
    "- *Code block*: We write a sequence of steps to execute R code inside two curly brackets {}. **Important: Any variables that were created inside this code block are deleted after the function is finished.**\n",
    "- *Return*: Inside the code block we can also include a return statement. This statement includes variables that were generated inside the code block that we wish to keep when the function is finished executing."
